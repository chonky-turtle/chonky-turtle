## About Me - My Journey

My fascination with technology started long before I could even spell “Python.” As a child, my favorite “toys” were nuts and bolts, old computer cases, and scrap hardware from my grandfather’s projects. At the age of 8, I built my very first robot—though my grandfather affectionately called me a child prodigy, my proudest contribution was probably adding a Barbie doll on top! That little robot sparked what would become a lifelong love for tinkering, building, and programming.

Since then, I’ve mentored robotics competitions, designing and programming robots while inspiring young learners to explore technology. My coding journey began with JavaScript, then C++ (to collaborate with my grandfather), and today Python is my language of choice. Over the past decade, I’ve applied Python across a wide range of areas: data engineering, data analysis, automation scripting, robotics, and even creative projects like building games and interactive tools.

Sharing my passion for tech and coding with learners has been one of the most rewarding parts of my journey. Every day I continue to explore, experiment, and expand my skills, always chasing that next “aha” moment that makes technology so exciting.

Right now, I’m diving deeper into advanced data engineering, cloud-based workflows, and ETL pipeline automation. I’m also exploring machine learning concepts and experimenting with building interactive dashboards to turn complex data into insights. Every new project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and push the boundaries of what I can create with technology.
